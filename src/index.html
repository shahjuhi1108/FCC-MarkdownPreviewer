<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">
      <h5 class="text-center">Editor</h5>
      <textarea oninput='makePreview()' class="form-control" rows=10 id="editor"># Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer!

## This is a sub-heading...
### And here's some other cool stuff:

Heres some code, `<div></div>`, between 2 backticks.

```
// this is multi-line code:

function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
  if (firstLine == '```' && lastLine == '```') {
    return multiLineCode;
  }
}
```

You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.com), and
> Block Quotes!

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
     - With different indentation levels.
        - That look like this.


1. And there are numbererd lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
1. And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:

    <div class="col">
      <h5 class="text-center">Preview</h5>
      <div class="border" id="preview"></div>
    </div>
